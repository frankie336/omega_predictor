# Omega Predictor

Omega Predictor is a sophisticated machine learning pipeline designed for real-time financial market prediction, specifically tailored for the forex market. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the Omega Predictor aims to provide accurate and timely predictions to empower decision-making.

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Leverage state-of-the-art models for live market analysis.
- **Modular Architecture**: A service-based architecture ensures easy maintenance and scalability. Components like `ModelWrapper`, `DataHandler`, and `DataLoaderService` provide clear separation of concerns and enhance modularity.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust preprocessing steps to prepare market data for prediction. The `DataHandler` service is designed to process and scale data efficiently.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of predictions and system performance. Predictions are logged for easy tracking and analysis.
- **Dynamic Model Management**: The `ModelRegistryService` centralizes model management, allowing for dynamic loading and easy updates to model versions.
