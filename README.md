Omega Predictor

Omega Predictor is a sophisticated machine learning pipeline designed for real-time financial market prediction, specifically tailored for the forex market. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the Omega Predictor aims to provide accurate and timely predictions to empower decision-making.

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Leverage state-of-the-art models for live market analysis.
- **Modular Architecture**: A service-based architecture ensures easy maintenance and scalability. Components like `ModelWrapper`, `DataHandler`, and `DataLoaderService` provide clear separation of concerns and enhance modularity.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust preprocessing steps to prepare market data for prediction. The `DataHandler` service is designed to process and scale data efficiently.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of predictions and system performance. Predictions are logged for easy tracking and analysis.
- **Dynamic Model Management**: The `ModelRegistryService` centralizes model management, allowing for dynamic loading and easy updates to model versions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later.
- PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and other required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/frankie336/omega_predictor.git2. Navigate to the project directory:cd omega_predictor3. Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

To start using the Omega Predictor, ensure you have the necessary data and model files in the appropriate directories. Here is a basic example of how to use the predictor:

```python
from omega_predictor.svc.model.simple_classifier import SimpleClassifier
from omega_predictor.svc.data.data_handler import DataHandler
from omega_predictor.svc.pred.model_wrapper import ModelWrapper

# Initialize the data handler
data_handler = DataHandler()

# Load your trained model
model = SimpleClassifier(input_size=10)  # Assuming '10' is the correct input size for your model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path_to_trained_model.pt'))
model.eval()

# Wrap the model with the ModelWrapper for prediction
model_wrapper = ModelWrapper(model)

# Process your input data
df = your_input_dataframe  # Replace this with your actual data in a pandas DataFrame
tensor_data = data_handler.df_to_tensor(df)

# Make predictions
prediction = model_wrapper.predict(tensor_data)

# The 'prediction' variable now holds the model's predictionThis script demonstrates the basic flow from data handling to prediction. Replace the placeholders with your actual data paths and parameters.ContributionAs a growing project, we welcome contributions of all forms.
